This repository contains all Wether Briefing research work done by Seattle Sports crew "A-Team" 

Dear Weather Rockets of the A-Team!

Welcome to our A-Team-Weather-Taskforce and thank you very much for your enthusiasm to support this great task.

Angela has kindly asked me to Lead the Creation of our Weather Briefing and thus I have the great pleasure to introduce you to our upcoming task.  

We will have to collect and process a good amount of data, but I am certain that each and everyone of you will do a fantastic job.

In order to tackle this task systematically, I have split each Leg of the Race into individual sectors, thus dividing the long distances in logical climatic zones and areas.

Some Legs may have more Sectors than others due to the differing complexity of each legâ€™s meteorological Phenomena.

I did my very best to pair each and everyone of you with your corresponding leg on the race. Since we had a great amount of crew members volunteering for our weather briefing from Leg 3 and we have been short on other legs, I had to reassign a few crew members participating in leg 3 on different legs. Nevertheless those crew members will be working on sectors and legs adjacent to their race legs, thus getting a great insight of their region nevertheless. 

In these upcoming attachments, please find an introduction of each Leg / Sector as well as the required Weather and Current Data which we would require. 

Attached, you will also find an Excel, which I would like you to fill out corresponding to your Sector and Leg. 

Please take your time and read the attached document thoroughly. Should you require any clarification (perhaps my phraseology may not have been understandable), please do not hesitate to contact me.

Also, please note that our very first deadline to hand in research is coming up in 3 1/2 weeks, on June 23rd 2025.
This deadline is very important as subsequent work and processing will be required. Therefore, please be very mindful of this deadline and if you should not be able to fulfill your Segment (on time), please let me know well in advance to make time for a reassignment to another crew member.

With this being said, I am looking forward to working together with all of you (pre sailing) and am looking forward to all your research!

Have a very great weekend - on the waters, at home or anywhere else :)

Kind Greetings from Kiel - Sailing City
